        <p>Hi there! I'm Karolis (31). I make art. I am very lucky to have the opportunity to dedicate my life to research topics closest to my heart, such as music, moving images, interactive art, science and philosophy. So far I have attended universities in Lithuania, the United States and the United Kingdom and my topics of study were psychology, film and music. Currently my topic of study is coding. I see it as the bridge that connects all of my other passions which makes me tremendously excited for the future!</p>
